Created a checkbox test. But instead of realying heavily on HTML, this relies more on JavaScript. Using arrays etc the data gets populated on the page through append.  To test which one is correct, made use of jQuery map to turn the checkboxes into an actual array then compare it to another array. If correct it adds up and if it meets a certian number (the correct amount is the same length as the array that contains the correct answers) it will show the correct redimiation.  If not it will show the incorrect redimation.
